Easy Stop/Start for Websites (App services)
===========================================

            
This script stops/starts websites (app services) just by given a
**Website name**.

First step is, you need to create an credential asset and update $CredentialAssetName variable in the code. And then you can use the script by just a WebApp name for $WebAppName variable and select $Stop variable to $true for Stop
 website or $false for Start website. 

Ps: You need to import the latest AzureResourceManager module located in C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\PowerShell\ResourceManager.


Ps #2: [To create new credential asset with the Azure Portal* *](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-credentials#creating-a-new-credential-asset)** 


 




 




        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
